# Spaces for rent Figma design 

This is a figma design that I created for my final group project for our platform that will enable users to be able to rent and book a space for any activity. 

There are two files: 
- A form
- The landing page that would best describe what our app is about when a user stumbles upon it and would like to try it out.
